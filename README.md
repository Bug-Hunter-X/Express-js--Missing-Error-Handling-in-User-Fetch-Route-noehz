# Express.js: Missing Error Handling in User Fetch Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling in routes that interact with external resources (like databases).  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

The issue: The route fetches user data by ID.  If the user is not found, it correctly handles this case. However, it lacks error handling for database query failures.  A failure could lead to unexpected errors or app crashes.

The solution: The improved code adds `try...catch` blocks to wrap database interactions, providing more robust error handling and preventing app crashes.  Appropriate error responses are sent to the client.
